# Getting Started with Deep Learning

## Hi There!

I've recently started out on my journey with Deep Learning. This repository consists of one of the very first projects I had made, i.e. creating a primitive classification model
using Python. The code consists of two architectures, the MP Neuron and Perceptron, used for Binary Classification. The dataset used for the task is a _Breast Cancer Database_, imported from SkLearn Datasets. This source of the data is the UC Irvine Machine Learning repository. The data has been originally collected from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison. 

The outline of what has been implemented in the notebook is as follows

- Importing the data and visualizing it using Pandas.
- Splitting the data for training and testing.
- Since our MP Neuron takes only binary data, we will create Binarised data to train upon.
- Code for testing the working and functionality of the MP Neuron (Basic loops and conditional statements).
- Structured Class for the MP Neuron model, followed by training.
- Structured Class for the Perceptron model, followed by training and visualization.
- Animation of how the weights learn and adapt to our data.

Side Note: The actual video is not displayed in the output, but will be generated if you run the code cells.
